Minicraft
===========

Minicraft is developed by Megabyte Computers and other developers. Our goals are to improve the Miniblok engine to allow more developer to quickly tap into the engine.


Roadmap
------------------
Update 1 (Understanding)
* Comment the source code.
* The goal of this update is to allow others to understand what is going on and how things have developed.

Update 2 (Sprite Rendering)
* Remove colors from the code and add them to the sprites.
* Chop of the sprites into their own files.
* This should make it easier for developers to add in new creatures and items.

Update 3 (Unknown)

Quick Notes
------------------
There is a funny note that is incorrect and will stay in the game for now. :)
